# Big thanks to http://www.kaizou.org/2014/11/gtest-cmake/ for initially helping me use ExternalProject to setup libraries
# Though, since reading this link, I have heavily modified the provided example to be more generic as demonstrated in the function below

# module required for including external projects (libraries)
include(ExternalProject)

# Configures an external CMake project and creates a static library target for it
# <url> should point to an archive of a CMake library with a CMakeLists.txt in the root directory
# An external project will be created and populated by the contents at the given <url>
# <static_library_path> should be a file path (or name) relative to the external project's binary directory pointing to the external project's built static library file
# A new library target will be created with the name <libname>
# Additionally, two variables will be initialized as "return values": <libname>_SRC and <libname>_BIN that point to
# the source directory and the binary directory of the external project respectively
function(add_external_static_cmake_library libname url static_library_path)
