Ideally, the CMake script would handle downloading all the dependencies from other repositories, but I suck at CMake, so for now, this will have to do...

Setting Up Dependencies For Ubuntu:

1. Install SDL2
- sudo apt install libsdl2-dev

2. Install Gtest
- sudo apt install libgtest-dev
- cd /usr/src/gtest/
- sudo cmake .
- sudo make
- sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/
